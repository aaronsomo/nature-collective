## Usage

Users are able to search for beautiful images of nature. Successful searches result in a list of 25 images with a title, the author of the image, and a source link to view the image's thread. Users can, then, select any images they'd like and the selected images' titles will be listed at the top of the web application. Selected images can be un-selected, removing them from the list.
